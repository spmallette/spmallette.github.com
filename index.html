  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Genoprime, LLC is a software engineering consulting company.  This site, stephen@genoprime, started as simple experiment with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jeckyll</a> and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> and I've come to like the experiment enough to turn this into my blog and general home page.</p>
  <p>My experience spans a number of industries, however the core of my efforts over the last ten years or so have been in healthcare and includes experience with Electronic Health Records, medical billing, and pharmaceutical business intelligence.  I've been fortunate to work with a number of start-up companies during this time and understand the challenges that they face.</p>
