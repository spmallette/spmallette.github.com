title: .NET Client for Kafka Checkpoint
layout: post

I'd written several posts in the past for some work I did for "Kafka":https://github.com/apache/kafka/, which is a distributed publish/subscribe messaging system.  Here's a conclusive list of those posts from some months back:

* ".NET Client for Kafka":http://stephen.genoprime.com/2011/03/01/dotnet-client-for-kafka.html
* ".NET Client for Kafka Checkpoint":http://stephen.genoprime.com/2011/03/11/dotnet-client-for-kafka-checkpoint.html
* ".NET Client for Kafka Multi-request":http://stephen.genoprime.com/2011/03/28/dotnet-client-for-kafka-multi-request.html

After getting a message, which asked about my specific work with the C# client and mentioned some dead links to its location, I realized that I should probably close out this part of the story.  I no longer maintain the C# client for Kafka which is available "here":https://github.com/apache/kafka/tree/trunk/clients/csharp.  Maintenance was picked up by someone external to the Kafka project, who made a number of enhancements to my original work and was then contributed back to Kafka.
