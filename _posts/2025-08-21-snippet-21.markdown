  Unpacks subtle differences in Gremlin’s repeat step when `times(0)` is used
---

The `repeat()` step in Gremlin has some noteworthy behavior when used with `times(0)`. Most of us intuitively expect that `times(1)` means “do it once” and `times(0)` means “skip it completely.” But depending on *where* you specify `times()`, the semantics are not quite what you might first imagine.

Consider the following Gremlin Console session:

{% highlight text %}
gremlin> g.V().repeat(out().limit(1)).times(1)
==>v[3]
gremlin> g.V().repeat(out().limit(1)).times(0)
==>v[3]
gremlin> g.V().times(1).repeat(out().limit(1))
==>v[3]
gremlin> g.V().times(0).repeat(out().limit(1))
==>v[1]
==>v[2]
==>v[3]
==>v[4]
==>v[5]
==>v[6]
{% endhighlight %}

At first glance, `times(1)` behaves exactly as expected in both positions: the traversal applies the repeat once. No surprises there.

Where things get interesting is with `times(0)`:

* **With `repeat(...).times(0)`** - You get the same result as `times(1)`. This is because when `times()` is applied *after* `repeat()`, its semantics are handled like a `do/while`. That is, the `repeat()` always executes once before the "how many times?" condition is enforced. So even though you asked for "0 times," the traversal still enters the `repeat()` a first time.

* **With `times(0).repeat(...)`** – The behavior flips. Here the traversal sees the `times(0)` before entering the repeat, giving it `while/do` semantics instead. Since the condition is "zero times," the traverser never enters `repeat()`. Instead, it simply passes through unchanged. That’s why, in this case, you just get the original set of vertices back.

So the placement of `times()` fundamentally changes the control flow:

- **Postfix (`repeat(...).times(n)`)** - `do/while` semantics (always one iteration, then check).
- **Prefix (`times(n).repeat(...)`)** - `while/do` semantics (check first, then maybe iterate).

This quirk in Gremlin’s semantics isn’t a bug, but it can be surprising to discover that sometimes `times(0)` doesn’t actually mean “zero.”
