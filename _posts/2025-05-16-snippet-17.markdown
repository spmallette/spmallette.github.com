## Understanding dedup() on Path Objects

The `dedup()` step has some interesting behavior when used on a `Path` object and could lead to some unexpected results if not taken into consideration. The following example shows some basic usage:

{% highlight text %}
gremlin> g.V().union(out().path(), out().path())
==>[v[1],v[3]]
==>[v[1],v[2]]
==>[v[1],v[4]]
==>[v[1],v[3]]
==>[v[1],v[2]]
==>[v[1],v[4]]
==>[v[4],v[5]]
==>[v[4],v[3]]
==>[v[4],v[5]]
==>[v[4],v[3]]
==>[v[6],v[3]]
==>[v[6],v[3]]
gremlin> g.V().union(out().path(), out().path()).dedup()
==>[v[1],v[3]]
==>[v[1],v[2]]
==>[v[1],v[4]]
==>[v[4],v[5]]
==>[v[4],v[3]]
==>[v[6],v[3]]
{% endhighlight %}

In the prior example, the `dedup()` step removes all of the duplicate `Path` objects to produce just a unique set. 

## The Impact of Step Labeling on dedup() and Path

A small change to this traversal however could greatly alter the results for `dedup()`. When you label steps in Gremlin with `as()`, those labels are referenced in the `Path` object and then `dedup()` behaves differently as shown in the next example.

{% highlight text %}
gremlin> g.V().union(out().as('x').path(), out().path())
==>[v[1],v[3]]
==>[v[1],v[2]]
==>[v[1],v[4]]
==>[v[1],v[3]]
==>[v[1],v[2]]
==>[v[1],v[4]]
==>[v[4],v[5]]
==>[v[4],v[3]]
==>[v[4],v[5]]
==>[v[4],v[3]]
==>[v[6],v[3]]
==>[v[6],v[3]]
{% endhighlight %}

The `dedup()` step is doing equality checks on the `Path` object which is the `Vertex` (in this case) but also the labels. Even though the objects are the same, the `Path` objects are technically different. It's difficult to see that in Gremlin Console, and perhaps other tools because the labels aren't visible as part of the `Path` string representation. They are however accessible on the `Path` object itself:

{% highlight text %}
gremlin> path = g.V().union(out().as('x').path(), out().path()).next()
==>v[1]
==>v[3]
gremlin> path.labels()
==>[]
==>[x]
{% endhighlight %}

## Workarounds and Best Practices for Path Deduplication

The workaround that will ensure that the `dedup()` will not take labels into account is to deconstruct the `Path` to a `List` with `unfold()` which will strip all of the labels:

{% highlight text %}
gremlin> g.V().union(out().as('x').path(), out().path()).map(unfold().fold()).dedup()
==>[v[1],v[3]]
==>[v[1],v[2]]
==>[v[1],v[4]]
==>[v[4],v[5]]
==>[v[4],v[3]]
==>[v[6],v[3]]
{% endhighlight %}

When working with `Path` objects in Gremlin, it's important to be aware that `dedup()` considers both the objects and any labels attached to the path. This can lead to unexpected results where paths that appear identical in the console are treated as distinct due to differing labels. If the goal is to deduplicate solely on the objects traversed, without regard to labels, deconstruct the `Path` to a `List` before applying `dedup()`. Understanding this nuance can help avoid subtle bugs and ensure your traversals return the results expected.
