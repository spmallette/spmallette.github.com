## Understanding Vertex Labels in Graph Databases

Graph databases like those powered by Apache TinkerPop provide a robust framework for working with connected data. However, as with any powerful tool, there are ways to misuse it and one such common anti-pattern is using unique values for vertex labels. While this topic has been covered in other blog posts, Stackoverflow posts, books and graph database documentation, it still remains a trap that newcomers to graphs seem to make and therefore begs another treatment of the topic.

A vertex label is a string that categorizes vertices into logical groups. For example, a social network graph might have vertices labeled `person`, `post`, or `comment`. Labels help organize your data, enable efficient queries, and allow graph systems to optimize storage and indexing.

```groovy
g.addV('person').property('name', 'alice')
g.addV('person').property('name', 'bob')
```

Here, both vertices are labeled 'person', making it easy to query all people in the graph.

## The Unique Vertex Label Anti-Pattern

A common mistake is to use a vertex label as if it were a unique identifier or a property. For instance, someone might assign a label to each vertex that is unique to that vertex:

```gremlin
g.addV('user_1').property('name', 'alice')
g.addV('user_2').property('name', 'bob')
```

Or, worse, use a label that is derived from a property value:

```gremlin
g.addV('alice').property('name', 'alice')
g.addV('bob').property('name', 'bob')
```

This approach misuses the label concept and leads to several problems.

## Consequences of Misusing Vertex Labels

Vertex labels are intended for grouping and filtering, not for uniqueness. When you use unique labels, you lose the ability to efficiently query a category of vertices. For example, to find all users in the graph above, you would have to scan every possible label, which is impractical:

```gremlin
// This is not possible if every user has a unique label!
g.V().hasLabel('person')
```

Instead, you would have to use a property filter, which may not be as efficient as a label-based index:

```gremlin
g.V().has('name', within('alice', 'bob'))
```

But this only works if you know all possible names, and it may not leverage label-based indexes.

[Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) and other graph databases optimize queries by using labels as a primary filter. If every vertex has a unique label, Neptune cannot use label-based indexes to speed up queries. This forces the engine to scan the entire graph, degrading performance—especially as the graph grows.

Additionally, Neptune treats each distinct vertex label as a predicate. If you have thousands or millions of unique labels, you risk hitting performance limits due to high predicate counts. [Neptune’s documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/gremlin-traversal-tuning.html) specifically warns about the negative impact of high numbers of predicates on query performance.

Graph visualization tools often use vertex labels to group and color nodes. If every vertex has a unique label, visualizations become cluttered and lose their ability to convey meaningful structure. Instead of seeing clear categories (like “person” or “post”), you see a sea of indistinguishable nodes. In addition, these tools are likely not optimized for this anti-pattern and may encounter basic performance problems as a result.

## Practical Examples and Correct Usage

Consider a graph where each user has a unique label:

```gremlin
g.addV('user_1').property('name', 'alice')
g.addV('user_2').property('name', 'bob')
```
To find all users, you cannot use a label filter, so you must resort to property-based queries, which are less efficient:

```gremlin
g.V().has('name', within('alice', 'bob'))
```
If you add more users, the query becomes increasingly unwieldy and slow.

## The Correct Approach

Use vertex labels to group vertices by type, and use properties for unique identifiers or other attributes. For example:

```gremlin
g.addV('person').property('name', 'alice')
g.addV('person').property('name', 'bob')
```

Now, you can efficiently query all people:

```gremlin
g.V().hasLabel('person')
```

Or find a specific person by name:

```gremlin
g.V().has('person', 'name', 'alice')
```

This approach leverages label-based indexing, improves query performance, and makes your graph easier to understand and visualize.
